                I have lived all over the United States (Alabama, California, Minnesota, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and New York), 
                but my longest residence was in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis/Saint Paul, MN. Before moving to Japan in 2015 I lived in 
                Minnesota for 17 years. My wife, Kira, and I still own our house in St Paul and plan on returning in 2020. We moved to Tokyo when 
                she accepted a position at the Montessori School of Tokyo where she is the Elementary and Middle School Coordinator. We 
                have three children, our two daughters,Melanie and Sarah, live in Massachusetts and our son, Michael, lives with us in our apartment in Minato-ku. 
                I am unabashadly geeky, love to cook, and hope to run the Tokyo Marathonn next year.               
            </p>
            <p>
                I have mostly made my living as a Database Administrator and Developer working with Microsoft SQL Server. 
                I have also done some work with other database engines including MySQL, Oracle, DB2, Postgres, and MongoDB, but I am 
                mostly a Microsoft person. If you want to talk about databases sometime let me know. I have been teaching myself JavaScript 
                and web development intermittently since we moved to Tokyo using resources like freeCodeCamp and Codecademy. I am looking
                forward to the next step on my journey when I begin the Code Chrysalis Advanced Coding Bootcamp in April.
